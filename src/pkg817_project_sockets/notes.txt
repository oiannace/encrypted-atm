- client and server need to authentication with the KDC like Alice and Bob did in lab 3
- but have kAB be a password they use to generate AES encryption/decryption
- then username and password are sent to server encrypted, and server checks db for them
- then user can select options (withdrawl/deposit/check balance), that request is sent encrypted to server, and then server completes action
